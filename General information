1. A method cannot be created in another method.

2. Object reference variable will store only non static methods.

3.Why string is immutable and Final?
	1.String pool in method area in memory
	  String s1 = "Java";
	  String s2 = "Java"; common memory location is given to value "java" from where the variable s1 s2 reference it
	  string is immutable means string value cannot be changed
	2.Security
	3.Class loading mechanism: 
	4.optimisation and performance: no need to generate n number of hashcode of multiple strings
	5.integer,long,double,float - wrapper classes -- immutable and final
